# JobCity — PRD (living)

## Original problem statement (verbatim)

> Using emergent I want to build a map with 2 cities one for Job applicants and one for companies where applicants can apply, this idea is something similar to https://www.thegitcity.com/ AND THEIR GITHUB https://github.com/srizzon/git-city where every building represents a git account/user and the number of recent commits they've done and can compare with other git users on number of commits. Similarly I want applicants city where buildings represent applicants and stats like how many jobs they've applied in job's city (with companies). The jobs city should be like USA Map with company buildings representing according to the location on job description which will be taken (either scrapping or API endpoints) from jobright, indeed, linkedin, simplify, yc, built-in spread out according to location and company name. (For example if Amazon has posted 10 jobs in Seattle, LA, SF, Atlanta, with 2, 3, 2, 3 jobs respectively, then Seattle should have a building named Amazon with 2 floors because 2 jobs in Seattle, and LA should have building of Amazon with 3 floors.)

## User-confirmed choices (Feb 2026)
- MVP scope: both cities (Jobs City richer)
- Auth: JWT email/password + Emergent Google login
- Job data: **real ingestion in MVP** (RemoteOK + Greenhouse public boards) on top of seeded data
- Aesthetic: low-poly dusk for Jobs City, cyberpunk-night for Applicants City
- Push to GitHub: user will use Emergent "Push to GitHub" button after build

## Architecture
- React 19 + React Three Fiber + drei + three.js (3D)
- FastAPI (async) + Motor (Mongo) + PyJWT + bcrypt
- MongoDB collections: users, applicants, companies, jobs, applications, user_sessions
- Auth: JWT (cookies + Bearer parallel), with Emergent Google session bridge
- Data ingestion: `services/ingestion.py` (RemoteOK feed + Greenhouse public boards)

## Personas
1. **Sam the Applicant** — recent grad, exploring & applying.
2. **Priya the Power Applicant** — wants comparison vs peers.
3. **Visitor (no account)** — explores cities, prompted to sign up at apply.

## Routes
- `/` Landing (dual-CTA)
- `/jobs-city` 3D Jobs City
- `/applicants-city` 3D Applicants City
- `/jobs/:id` Job detail + Apply
- `/applicants/:id` Applicant profile
- `/profile` (auth) My applications & building
- `/compare` Side-by-side comparison
- `/login`, `/register`

## What's been implemented (through Feb 14, 2026 — iterations 1–3)
- ✅ JWT email/password auth + Emergent Google session bridge
- ✅ MongoDB models with UUID `user_id` (no ObjectId leakage), unique indexes
- ✅ Seed script: 20 companies, ~404 templated jobs, 30 demo applicants, demo applications, admin + demo accounts
- ✅ Real data ingestion: **RemoteOK + Greenhouse + Lever + YC/HN**, server-side **filter to Software/ML/Robotics only** (`services/job_filter.py`); ~763 active jobs split 118 software / 55 ML / 27 robotics across 38 companies. Auto-refresh every 6h.
- ✅ Aggregation endpoints: `/api/jobs-city/buildings` and `/api/applicants-city/buildings`
- ✅ 3D Jobs City — **sqrt-scaled building heights** (no more 167-floor monoliths), **procedural window textures on every building** (Canvas-generated, lit/unlit grid), **point-light glow on hover & selection**, InstancedMesh path for short buildings, multi-tier skyscrapers with spires for tall ones, search-bar dim
- ✅ 3D Applicants City — same windows + glow + sqrt scaling, neon experience-level palette, GitHub antennas, skyscrapers for power users, search-bar dim by name/level/github
- ✅ Apply flow with duplicate prevention, cover note, toast feedback
- ✅ AI match score on `/jobs/:id` — Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM key, 24h cache
- ✅ GitHub link on `/profile` — paste a username, public events API counts last-30-day commits and updates the antenna
- ✅ Profile page with my-building link, GitHub form, stat tiles, applications list
- ✅ Compare page with bar charts and top-companies stats
- ✅ Landing page with dual-image hero, glass-morphism, Unbounded + Outfit + JetBrains Mono fonts
- ✅ NavBar with sign-in/out/profile links
- ✅ r3f patched to ignore `x-*` JSX props injected by visual-edits babel plugin
- ✅ Deployment health check: PASS
- ✅ Testing agent runs: **iter_1 (14/14 + e2e)**, **iter_2 (25/25 + e2e)**, **iter_3 (7/7 skyscraper + search e2e)** — all green

## Iteration 4 — Feb 15, 2026 (this session)
- ✅ Restored missing `.env` files (backend + frontend) after fork, added `.env.example` templates
- ✅ JobDetail UX overhaul: AI brief (summary + required/nice-to-have skills) auto-loads on mount; "Score me" button removed; external Apply opens job portal in new tab; "Did you apply?" `AlertDialog` triggers on tab return via `visibilitychange` + `focus` listeners; seed jobs without `source_url` skip new-tab and open dialog directly
- ✅ New `ApplicantRoads` component: horizontal + vertical asphalt strips with cyan neon center stripes form a grid between applicant towers (24×24, spacing 2.4)
- ✅ Emergent LLM Key wired in — `/api/jobs/{id}/summary` and `/api/jobs/{id}/match-score` confirmed live with Claude Sonnet 4.5
- ✅ Login.jsx defaults aligned with seed (`demo@jobcity.test` / `Demo123!`)
- ✅ Visually verified via screenshot tool (frontend testing agent struggles with WebGL canvases)

## Iteration 5 — Feb 15, 2026 (this session continued)
- ✅ **CORS fix**: switched API axios client to `withCredentials: false` so Cloudflare's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` override no longer breaks credentials-mode preflight in Emergent preview. Auth still works via Bearer token in localStorage.
- ✅ **Applicants City revamp** — Sheet drawer side panel replaces nav to `/applicants/:id`; shows title, applications count, skills, GitHub stats, and clickable resume link only (no jobs list)
- ✅ **Compare flow** — click = open side panel (focus glow only, no auto-select). "+ Add to compare" button in the side panel stacks up to 4 applicants; floating dock at the bottom shows chips with remove-X + "Compare side-by-side →" CTA
- ✅ **Navigate to my tower** — top-right CTA visible only when logged in. Smoothly tweens camera + orbit-controls target to the user's building (ease-out cubic over ~1.25s) and opens its side panel.
- ✅ **New `/onboarding` page** — collected after register: title (with suggestion chips), experience level toggle, skills (chip multi-input), resume URL. All fields optional with "Skip for now". Backed by `PATCH /api/applicants/me`.
- ✅ Register flow now redirects to `/onboarding` instead of `/profile`.
- ✅ **Visual overhaul** of Applicants City to match the user's "pixelated lo-fi green night-city" reference:
  - Background `#091a12` (deep forest-green), fog matched
  - New `APPLICANT_CITY_COLORS` palette — bright mint/amber/orange so no building is invisible
  - Brighter dim multiplier (`× 0.7` instead of `× 0.6`) — towers never read as black
  - New `getGreenWindowTexture()` — pixelated `NearestFilter` neon-green / amber / dark-green window grid
  - Skyscrapers in Applicants City now accept `variant="green"` to use the same lo-fi texture
  - Roads now use dark forest-green base with neon-green stripes
- ✅ Backend `PATCH /api/applicants/me` endpoint accepts `title`, `headline`, `skills`, `resume_url`, `experience_level`
- ✅ Applicants schema gains `title` and `resume_url` (both optional)
- ✅ `/api/applicants-city/buildings` response now includes `title` so it shows on hover tooltip + side panel

## Test credentials
- `demo@jobcity.app` / `Demo123!` (applicant, 5 applications)
- `admin@jobcity.app` / `Admin123!` (admin)
- Stored in `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`

- [ ] Resume upload (object storage) → parse → auto-fill profile + skills
- [ ] Recommended jobs panel (pre-compute match for top-10 jobs nightly)
- [ ] Weekly Top Hiring City leaderboard
- [ ] Achievement badges on top of buildings

## Known constraints
- Preview Cloudflare proxy overrides `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` with credentials; we rely on Bearer header for programmatic calls, cookies for browser session.
- visual-edits babel plugin injects `x-*` attributes on every JSX element in dev; node_modules patch is applied at `/app/frontend/scripts/patch-r3f.sh` (run after any `yarn install`).
