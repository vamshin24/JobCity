# JobCity — PRD (living)

## Original problem statement (verbatim)

> Using emergent I want to build a map with 2 cities one for Job applicants and one for companies where applicants can apply, this idea is something similar to https://www.thegitcity.com/ AND THEIR GITHUB https://github.com/srizzon/git-city where every building represents a git account/user and the number of recent commits they've done and can compare with other git users on number of commits. Similarly I want applicants city where buildings represent applicants and stats like how many jobs they've applied in job's city (with companies). The jobs city should be like USA Map with company buildings representing according to the location on job description which will be taken (either scrapping or API endpoints) from jobright, indeed, linkedin, simplify, yc, built-in spread out according to location and company name. (For example if Amazon has posted 10 jobs in Seattle, LA, SF, Atlanta, with 2, 3, 2, 3 jobs respectively, then Seattle should have a building named Amazon with 2 floors because 2 jobs in Seattle, and LA should have building of Amazon with 3 floors.)

## User-confirmed choices (Feb 2026)
- MVP scope: both cities (Jobs City richer)
- Auth: JWT email/password + Emergent Google login
- Job data: **real ingestion in MVP** (RemoteOK + Greenhouse public boards) on top of seeded data
- Aesthetic: low-poly dusk for Jobs City, cyberpunk-night for Applicants City
- Push to GitHub: user will use Emergent "Push to GitHub" button after build

## Architecture
- React 19 + React Three Fiber + drei + three.js (3D)
- FastAPI (async) + Motor (Mongo) + PyJWT + bcrypt
- MongoDB collections: users, applicants, companies, jobs, applications, user_sessions
- Auth: JWT (cookies + Bearer parallel), with Emergent Google session bridge
- Data ingestion: `services/ingestion.py` (RemoteOK feed + Greenhouse public boards)

## Personas
1. **Sam the Applicant** — recent grad, exploring & applying.
2. **Priya the Power Applicant** — wants comparison vs peers.
3. **Visitor (no account)** — explores cities, prompted to sign up at apply.

## Routes
- `/` Landing (dual-CTA)
- `/jobs-city` 3D Jobs City
- `/applicants-city` 3D Applicants City
- `/jobs/:id` Job detail + Apply
- `/applicants/:id` Applicant profile
- `/profile` (auth) My applications & building
- `/compare` Side-by-side comparison
- `/login`, `/register`

## What's been implemented (through Feb 14, 2026 — iterations 1–3)
- ✅ JWT email/password auth + Emergent Google session bridge
- ✅ MongoDB models with UUID `user_id` (no ObjectId leakage), unique indexes
- ✅ Seed script: 20 companies, ~351 templated jobs, 30 demo applicants, demo applications, admin + demo accounts
- ✅ Real data ingestion: **RemoteOK + Greenhouse + Lever + YC/HN** = 1,400+ active jobs across 97 companies (auto-refresh every 6h via background scheduler)
- ✅ Aggregation endpoints: `/api/jobs-city/buildings` and `/api/applicants-city/buildings`
- ✅ 3D Jobs City — extruded USA polygon, **InstancedMesh** for short buildings, **multi-tier skyscrapers with spires for tall buildings (≥8 floors)**, dusk lighting, city label rings, search-bar dim
- ✅ 3D Applicants City — cyan grid floor, voxel towers colored by experience level, **multi-tier skyscrapers for power users (≥8 applications)**, GitHub antennas, night palette, search-bar dim by name/level/github
- ✅ Apply flow with duplicate prevention, cover note, toast feedback
- ✅ AI match score on `/jobs/:id` — Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM key, 24h cache
- ✅ GitHub link on `/profile` — paste a username, public events API counts last-30-day commits and updates the antenna
- ✅ Profile page with my-building link, GitHub form, stat tiles, applications list
- ✅ Compare page with bar charts and top-companies stats
- ✅ Landing page with dual-image hero, glass-morphism, Unbounded + Outfit + JetBrains Mono fonts
- ✅ NavBar with sign-in/out/profile links
- ✅ r3f patched to ignore `x-*` JSX props injected by visual-edits babel plugin
- ✅ Deployment health check: PASS
- ✅ Testing agent runs: **iter_1 (14/14 + e2e)**, **iter_2 (25/25 + e2e)**, **iter_3 (7/7 skyscraper + search e2e)** — all green

## Test credentials
- `demo@jobcity.app` / `Demo123!` (applicant, 5 applications)
- `admin@jobcity.app` / `Admin123!` (admin)
- Stored in `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`

## Prioritized backlog

### P0 — Done (shipped)
- [x] Auth, seed, ingestion, jobs-city, applicants-city, apply, profile, compare, navbar

### P1 — Next features
- [x] ~~Search/filter bars wired into 3D cities~~ (Jobs City + Applicants City both done)
- [x] ~~Lever + YC/HN public ingestion sources~~
- [x] ~~Background scheduled ingestion via FastAPI~~ (6h)
- [x] ~~GitHub linking + commit count sync~~ (public API, no OAuth)
- [x] ~~InstancedMesh refactor for cities with > 500 buildings~~ (perf)
- [x] ~~Multi-tier skyscraper geometry for tall buildings~~ (both cities, ≥8 floors)
- [ ] LinkedIn / Indeed (no public APIs available — defer or scrape)
- [ ] Mobile-detection → simplified scene (no shadows, no Stars)
- [ ] Pagination/virtualization for applicants when count > 500
- [ ] Email verification + password reset
- [ ] Public share cards ("my JobCity building" PNG)

### P2 — Intelligence layer
- [x] ~~Claude Sonnet 4.5 job-match score~~ (24h cached)
- [ ] Resume upload (object storage) → parse → auto-fill profile + skills
- [ ] Recommended jobs panel (pre-compute match for top-10 jobs nightly)
- [ ] Weekly Top Hiring City leaderboard
- [ ] Achievement badges on top of buildings
- [ ] Recruiter persona with saved searches

## Known constraints
- Preview Cloudflare proxy overrides `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` with credentials; we rely on Bearer header for programmatic calls, cookies for browser session.
- visual-edits babel plugin injects `x-*` attributes on every JSX element in dev; node_modules patch is applied at `/app/frontend/scripts/patch-r3f.sh` (run after any `yarn install`).
